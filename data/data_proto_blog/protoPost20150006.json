However,  Raymond the safety captain did not act in a fastidious manner and Aditiya was injured whilst lifting a heavy object and was left with a minor cut on the inner arm.  However, when Raymond finally got around to resolving the situation, he handled it properly by informing our mentor that someone was injured so that our mentor could administer the proper first aid (in this case, a simple bandage.)  Raymond’s team found organization quite tiring, so they postponed pool noodle cutting and the step construction until Monday.  Over the next couple of days, we analyzed the tote sliding out of the chute to asses how the robot frame should be modified to best adjust to the motion of the tote.  We used a tracking software and frame analysis by keyframing the video of the tote.  From this, we could extrapolate the position and velocity of the tote.  By the end of the meeting, Raymond spent the evening utilizing Autodesk Inventor to model how the linear bearing will attach to the U-shaped chassis that Ammar suggested.  Raymond, Hrayr, and Levon worked on the step, which is one of the field elements in which totes will be stacked in a particular location.  Oliver and Raymond worked on CADing the design of the robot, including the elevation mechanism and the lifting claw.","$$hashKey":"object:202"},{"type":"text","content":"Mechanical (Aakash, Vivian, Ammar, Michelle, Joanne)  spent time working on the elevation mechanism and the claw.  We went through a plethora of claw designs but we are still working on finalizing the materials and the way the claw clamps.  In addition, programming and electrical (Javagod, Michael, Amitav, Hrayr) have been testing materials to use for our elevation system.  We also finished building the U-shaped chassis and mounted the electrical board onto the robot.  Proper integration derivative, or PID, is a system of reading input and releasing output for sensors and motors.  It allows us to ask the motor to move to a specific set point and the speed at which is runs is calculated automatically by using proportions. We also set up the camera that will be used to track the reflective tape on the totes.","$$hashKey":"object:205"},{"type":"text","content":"FTC received their Kit of Parts and began prototyping for their robot.  Athena, Omega, and The Resistors worked on code, their chassis, and prototyping to determine which lifts work best for their robots.","$$hashKey":"object:208"},{"type":"text","content":"We will see you very soon!
